TODO : Add configuration file?

## Overview

Create a profile targeting a specific game, then manage your savefiles ! Backups, autosaves, and others.

This is originally designed for Elden Ring/ Dark Souls games, but due to the inherent nature of savefiles, it can be used with any game that use a static folder to store their files.
I am obviously not responsible if you use this with a game that bans save-scumming (Not that I know of any).

Happy gaming !
